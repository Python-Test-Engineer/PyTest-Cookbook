# PyTest and Docker

Docker seems to be an essential part of testing work.

I have done many trainings on Docker and I would say the best training is on my favourite platform Udemy:
[Docker Bootcamp: Conquer Docker with Real-World Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-bootcamp-conquer-docker-with-real-world-projects)

Sales every two weeks or so will mean you can get if for $20 USD or so. 

What I really like about this course is it does not really go into theory but just builds a great number of microservices and connects them. Repetition makes it become part of the muscle and is probably what is needed for a Test Engineer.

There are other courses that go deeper and one that I find really good is: [Python in Containers](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-in-containers/)

## Demo One

PyTest-Full-Stack has an example using `pytest-docker`.

*Ensure docker desktop or equivalent is running!* ðŸ˜¬ 

Located in tests/docker. My usual folder naming of 70_docker is unacceptable so I just use docker.

There is a YT video of this: [pytest-docker](https://youtu.be/43YKqEg49HI)

## Demo Two

Located in `tests/_isolated_suites/docker-pytest-poetry-fixtup-RUN_ISOL`

This is based on the following article: 

- https://dev.to/farcellier/test-beyond-your-code-with-docker-pytest-3b7g


I have included it here for reference. It won't work with PyTest-Full-Stack and needs to be in its own separate suite.

Open tests/_isolated_suites/docker-pytest-poetry-fixtup-RUN_ISOL in own IDE

- `python -m venv venv`
- `.\venv\Scripts\activate` or Mac equivalent
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- ensure you remove REACTIVATE_ from front of test_postgressql_database.py so PyTest can discover this test. It was made invisible in this way so it did not collide and fail running of PFS default set up.
- `python -m pytest .\tests\test_postgressql_database.py -vs`

*Make sure docker is running!*

## Other plugins

There are a number of docker plugins for pytest:

- `pytest-docker-compose`
- `pytest-docker-tools`
- `docker-python-unittest-pytest` is a more DIY setup.

## Docker-Postgres-PGAdmin-Adminer - to go

I have a [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mipRKPHwlBk )and [repo](https://github.com/Python-Test-Engineer/yt-docker-postgres-pgadmin-adminier-python-sql) that I have tested many times myself. It also uses my custom Postgres image which has PGVector extension added for Semantic Search, (AI RAG).
