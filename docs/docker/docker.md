# PyTest and Docker

## Demo example

PyTest-Full-Stack has an example using `pytest-docker`.

*Ensure docker desktop or equivalent is running!* ðŸ˜¬ 

Located in tests/docker. My usual folder naming of 70_docker is unacceptable so I just use docker.

## Other plugins

There are a number of docker plugins for pytest:

- `pytest-docker-compose`
- `pytest-docker-tools`
- `docker-python-unittest-pytest` is a more DIY setup.
