## About

I wanted to set up a new project using Hatch and understand how it uses environments.

When I use Python's venv, I create a virtual environment and then run my project in that.

Hatch lives outside of Python.

We set up in pyproject.toml a number of environments for different use cases such as dev, linting etc.

In the video and repo, I set up an environment that I will use during `dev` and show you a workflow for dev and testing.
