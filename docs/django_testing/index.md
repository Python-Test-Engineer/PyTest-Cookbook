# Django tesing

There are currently two suites - 05 and 05A

05A is based on MDN's tutorial for Django. I have adapted this and add some Bootstrap.

It has a nice testing structure of:
- test__models
- test__views
- test__forms

(I have seen the use of two underscores after test and I find this more aesthetic.)
