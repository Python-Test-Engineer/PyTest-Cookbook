# Django testing

*Currently under construction...*

Using the features of PyTest-Full-Stack, I am planning on developing an ecommerce Django app that will have testing as follows:

- SQL schemas
- Model testing
- Forms and views testing
- API testing
- E2E on the website using Playwright

This will be collated from a great range of sources and be, hopefully, a complete test framework for Django which one can use as a base for one's own projects.

I would also like to introduce Test Run Management by logging test runs etc into the Django DB so that we can use the app to manage data from test runs.
