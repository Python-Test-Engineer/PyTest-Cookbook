# Asides

## What are asides?

Asides are articles on useful aspects of PyTest Full Stack but are not part of a PyTest Full Stack Run.

For example, we have a folder `docker` that is integrated into PFS, but we also have an isolated set of docker tests that would need to be run in a separate and isolated environment with elements of PFS added in. 

Essentially the converse of what we are doing in PFS.

An example is tests/_isolated_suites which has a docker-postgres-fixtup suite.

## Planned asides

In due course and for example:

- Pluggy - the plugin architecture that PyTest uses.
- Mocking - covering the area of mocking, patching and monkeypatching.
- Docker - some ready to use set ups for use in mocking.
- Test naming - how the use of structured test names can be use for test management.
