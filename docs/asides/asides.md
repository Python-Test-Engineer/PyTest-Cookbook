# Asides

## What are asides?

 Asides are articles on useful aspects of PyTest Full Stack but are not part of an a PyTest Full Stack Run.

For example, we have a folder `docker` that is integrated into PFS, but we also have an isolated set of docker tests that would need to be run in a separate and isolated environment with elements of PFS added in. 

Essentially the convers of what we are doing in PFS.

An example is tests/_isolated which has a docker-poetry-postgres-fixtup suite.

## Planned asides
