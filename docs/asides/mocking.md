# Python Mock, Patch and Monkeypatch - deep dive

## About

I have created a repo and video series to dive deeper into what mock, patch and monkeypatch do behind the scenes.

Using Rich and PyBoxen for pretty console output, we look at globals() and sys.modules to see how we can create our own mocks and patches.

We will also look at the source code for `mock.py` as well as look at a number of template examples that I have collected from various named sources.

The repo is [here](https://github.com/Python-Test-Engineer/yt-python-mock) and the YT video series will be released early JUL2024.

I have endeavoured to make the repo heavily commented so that it can be used as an 'ebook'.
