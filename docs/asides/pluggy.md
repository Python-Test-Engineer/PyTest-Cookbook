# Pluggy

## About

I have uploaded a video and repo where I have encoded the 'complete example' in the docs and added a second plugin so that the host can be run with two plugins extending its functionality.

## Repo

A tested project is available here: [GiHub](https://github.com/Python-Test-Engineer/yt-eggsample-demo)

## YT Video

There is an explainer video (7mins) to walk through installation and running: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CqINfl9OMY)
