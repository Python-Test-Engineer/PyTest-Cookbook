# Tests
 
## 00_check_setup

These are used to test that:

- src and tests are wired correctly
- read config.ini in the config folder
- logging works and outputs to log/pytesting.log
- test a sample mock works

## 01_inspect

Using SQLModel's inspect, we run tests on SQL schema to verify foreign keys, check constraints etc exist. Inspired by Very Academy's TDD Fast Api course.

## 02_py_coffee

This is a great video series on PyTest. I have included the tests form his repo as part of the template tests. Links in repo.

## 05_mocks_patch

A large number of templated mocks and patches, with extensive code comments. I have adapted them as necessary and the links to the YouTube videos are included.

Some did not have source code so I transcribed the code from the videos.

## 10_py_api_pets

Using Playwright, the full CRUD api tests to https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/ is included providing templates for API testing.

## 20_playwright

A great range of End2End tests from a variety of sources.

## 50_pwe_bdd

A working example of using the pyTest-bdd, based on the awesome resource https://pytest-with-eric.com/ which is perhaps the best resource on PyTest available.

In time, more templates will be added, hevily commented to aid understanding and with videos as and when possible.
