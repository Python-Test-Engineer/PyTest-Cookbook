# PyTest_00_MINIMAL

## Set up

This uses PyTest_00_MINIMAL and is a simple wiring of src folder for your code and an tests folder for PyTest.

![test-suite](../assets/images/pytest-00-minimal.png ){:style="width:520px;border-radius:10%;border: 5px solid #555;"}

There is custom logging defined in pytest.ini that outputs to a `log` folder.

One of the tests `test_03_logging.py` uses logging in its tests.

- move to `PyTest_00_MINIMAL` folder and create a virtual environment, then install requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
