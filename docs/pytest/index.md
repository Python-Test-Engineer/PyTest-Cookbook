# PyTest

## Purpose of this book

To provide a range of ready congfigured PYTHON TEST FRAMEWORKS with a 'one step install', comprising of templates and references for developers to adapt to their own needs.

To provide curated resources of articles, videos and books that I have found useful.

Frameworks, apps and folders may well have additional README.md files to give more detailed instructions.
