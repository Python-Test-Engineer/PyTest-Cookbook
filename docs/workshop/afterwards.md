# Afterwards

## Cookbook

The cookbook covers many more items such as:

- Docker
- Asides on Mocking and Pluggy
- Toolbox for Console Prettying using Rich and PyBoxen, Allure reports, Visual Regression etc and I add more content as time passes.

Mocking can be a tricky subject. I have a video series that does a deep dive on mocking and also looks at the Python `mock.py` file so that we can understand what mocking is acutally doing.

## Revision 

[CoffeeBeforeArch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxNPSjHT5qvuZ_JT1bknzrS8YqLiMjNpS) and [Indian Pythonista](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyb_C2HpOQSBWGekd7PfhHnb9GnqDgrxS) are very good concise walkthroughs of PyTest covering beginner to advanced topics.


## Development

[PyTestWithEric](https://pytest-with-eric.com/), has probably the best set of articles and repos covering beginner to advanced topics and I have created videos of them and incorporating the GitHub code to provide a second content delivery medium, explaining salient points.
