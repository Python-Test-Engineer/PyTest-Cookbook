# Welcome

*Let's get comfortable and confident with PyTest.*

Welcome to the Getting Started with PyTest workshop.

There are a lot of resources both for the workshop and after so that you can feel *comfortable and confident* with PyTest.

There are a lot of features to PyTest and 80% of usage uses just 20% so I will highlight the essentials, the rest you just need to be aware of rather than fully grasp *now*.

## Who am I?

I am an 'adhoc' freelance Backend Pythonista and Test Automation Engineer living in Brighton, UK.

## Motivation

There are many great resources for PyTest and I wanted to curate them into one resource.

In my experience, I look for 3 things;

1. Good docs.
2. A repo that works out of the box.
3. Videos to explain concepts.

I hope PyTest FullStack, (PFS), achieves this.

We will work in a circular way, going back to concepts we have seen before. This helps learning, so don't be too concerned if things don't click at first.

## Agenda

We will split the workshop into four main sections:

### 1. PFS framework

Get familiar with all the resources available and download Python Full Stack which is a complete framework for PyTest with over 200 template tests from SQL to API/E2E testing with Playwright. 

Learn how to create this framework from scratch and we will learn how to use it and run/select tests.

*Please note you can just install PyTest and add a `tests` folder to your project and this will work fine.*

### 2. PyTest 101

- Create functional and class based test templates.
- Test discovery customisation.
- Running tests.
- Selecting tests with `-k` (like) and markers.
- Using built in markers to skip tests etc.


### 3. PyTest 102

We will look at PyTest features to make testing easier:

- Fixtures
- Parametrization
- Conftest.py
- Plugins for HTML Reports, Coverage and performance, (pytest-xdist).

### 4. Afterwards

We will look at a great manyresources available afterwards to help refresh and deepen your understanding. These range from videos, some made by me and the rest by the community, as well articles and other materials.

*My intention is for you to feel comfortable and confident with PyTest, ready to use and deepen your skill set from today.*
