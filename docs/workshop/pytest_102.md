# PyTest 102

## Fixtures

### Definition

[https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html)

Fixtures are requested by test functions or other fixtures by declaring them as argument names.

They are an example of dependency injection and replace the setup/teardown features of Unit Test.

Fixtures can thus use other fixtures. They are Python functions and can be the arguments of other functions.

### Implementation

`tests\02_py_coffee\02_fixtures\00_basic_fixtures\test_fiztures_0.py` is an example:

```

@pytest.fixture
def initial_value():
    return 5

def square(num: int) -> int:
    return num * num

# We pass in the fixture - dependency injection
def test_0240_FXT_square(initial_value: int) -> None:
    result = square(initial_value)
    assert result == initial_value**2
```



### Yield and addfinalizer()

```
@pytest.fixture()
def my_object_fixture():
    print("Yielding fixture data...")
    yield MyObjectThatRequiresCleanUp()
    print("Do clean up after test has run...")
```

```
@pytest.fixture
def setup_data(request):
    # setup_data is now the fixture name we pass into our test...
    print("\nSetting up resources...")
    data = 22
    
    # Define a finalizer function for teardown
    def finalizer():
        print("\nPerforming teardown...")
        # Clean up any resources if needed

    # Register the finalizer to ensure cleanup
    request.addfinalizer(finalizer)

    return data  # Provide the data to the test
```

### Built in fixtures

There are many built in fixtures provided by PyTest but I only use a few of them:

[https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/fixtures.html#built-in-fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/fixtures.html#built-in-fixtures)
![built in fixtures](../images/workshop/built-in-fixtures.png)
![built in fixtures](../images/workshop/built-in-fixtures-2.png)

Fixture availability is determined from the perspective of the test. A fixture is only available for tests to request if they are in the scope that fixture is defined in. If a fixture is defined inside a class, it can only be requested by tests inside that class. But if a fixture is defined inside the global scope of the module, then every test in that module, even if itâ€™s defined inside a class, can request it.

## Conftest

`conftest.py` is automatically discovered and registered by PyTest. It is a good place to store fixtures so that they can be reused in the folder it is located in and any subfolders.

It does not need to be imported.

If a fixture appears in many `conftest.py` files then the closest `conftest.py` file to the test is used.

Example is: `02_py_coffee\02_fixtures\test_conftest_2` demonstrating that the closest `conftest.py` fixture value is used. 

## Parametrization

We may want to run a test for a range of values, e.g, we may want to test our `add()` for a range of values.

Rather than do some Pythonic looping over a test, we can use the `@pytest.mark.parametrize()` to decorate the test and supply our values in this decorator.

A decorator is a function that wraps another function and any values passed into the deocrator are available to the inner function by the closure created.

### Examples

- `tests\03_indian_pythonista\ip_04_parametrize\tests\test_sample.py`
- `python -m pytest -vs -k TestClassSetUp`

```
n and expected are variable names that take values of supplied list
@pytest.mark.parametrize("n, expected", [(1, 2), (3, 4)])
class TestClass:
    def test_simple_case(self, n, expected):
        assert n + 1 == expected

    def test_weird_simple_case(self, n, expected):
        assert (n * 1) + 1 == expected
```

### Output

![parametrization](../images/workshop/parametrization-example.png)

### Options

There are a great many options available:


- Add ids for more human readable output.
- Using the indirect=True parameter when parametrizing a test allows to parametrize a test with a fixture receiving the values before passing them to a test.

## Customisation by hooks

## Plugins

These are some of the most common plugins.

xdist aside, we can recreate some of the functionality through the use of hooks. The online course 'PyTest Cookbook - Using hooks to create plugins' that you will have a free coupon for will go through this in much more details.

*It is easier than one might think!*

### pytest-csv

We already create our own cutomisable CSV output.

### pytest-html

### pytest-cov

Coverage is an important metric.

### pytest-random

Ideally, all tests are independent of each other and randomising the order should not change the results of the test.

Randomising tests are a good way to test this.
